# FlipIt
Project for TechTogether Digital

# Welcome to Flip It! 
A website turned into a Flip it book! Why is reading so important? We have to read every day, whether it's from books, messages, or even from this website. Want to read more?-- Here are some book recommendations, best-selling books, and other resources. Just Flip It to learn more!

# Inspiration
Recently, I have been babysitting a five and three-year-old. Together, we have been reading books to strengthen their vocabulary. This inspired me to create a website all about reading. Whether we're young like them, or growing older, reading surrounds us in our everyday lives.

# What it does
It's a website that talks about reading and it's importance.

# How we built it
I built it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript on Replit.

# Challenges we ran into
A big challenge I ran into was not having enough time. I wanted to participate in techtogether digital, however, I knew I wasn't going to have much time to work on a project so I decided to do a solo and fun project.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud that I was able to register for a domain for my website, which is www.flipit.study (however, it is still taking time to link).

# What we learned
I learned how to create a slideshow using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which is the flipping book mechanism I decided on!

# What's next for FlipIt
In the future, I want to add more information, resources, and more complex software on FlipIt.
